## Internal Sorting Algorithms

The directory contains python implementation of internal sorting algorithms along with the analyses and proofs. The focus is given on the analyses of algorithms instead of just their implementations. Please keep in mind that the code written is only intended for academic exercise.

The following books were referenced for analytical proofs:
* [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844)
* [Data Structures and Algorithms Analysis in Java](https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithm-Analysis-Java-Allen/dp/0273752111)

Here is a run-time plots of the implemented sorting algorithms. You should observe that bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort and shell sort are running closer to N^2, while heap sort, merge sort and quick sort are running closer to NlogN.
