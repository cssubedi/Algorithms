### Bubble sort
Bubble sort works by moving larger elements to the end of an array $A$ by comparing $i$ and $i+1$ elements, and swapping if $A[i] > A[i+1]$. Bubble sort is stable sort as the relative position of duplicate elements is preserved. Because it does not require extra memory space, it is an in-place sorting algorithm.  

Running time = $O(N^2)$
