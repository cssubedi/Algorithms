The directory contains analyses, proofs and pseudocodes of some of the most common graph algorithms. A PDF file is generated from the raw markdown file that contains notes. Following topics have been discussed in details:
* Definition
* Representation
* Decomposition
* Paths
* Flows
* Spanning Trees
* Tours and Circuits

Graph, as a data structure, is implemented in the [DataStructures](https://github.com/cssubedi/DataStructures/tree/master/graph) repository.
